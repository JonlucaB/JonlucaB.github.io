<h1>music</h1><h1>Kids kind of a nerd...</h1>
<p>I started out as a band kid in high school. Before that, I was a legend in the living room with my rock band character named 'snot'. The best I can describe my high school
career was a 'classical' training. I learned everything from the vibraslap to the marching tenor drums to the vibraphone. To this day, I am still an avid vibraslap enthusiast, and I find ways to continue my musical journey.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Drumset</h2>
<p>My main goal is the drumset. After failing to join the Genesis Drum & Bugle Corps in 2019 I decided to take on the drumset after being told I 'wasn't a real percussionist if I didn't play the drumset...'
<br>
I have a Yamaha stage custom Honey Amber kit that is my go to. I paired it with some Zildjian Custom A cymbals and I use that for practice and gigs where I need to bring it for my band (see below).</p>
<br>
<h2>The Keys</h2>
<p>When I moved into my first house, I knew I needed to be able to play some music while the neighbors were asleep. The drums weren't an option, so I took up the piano. I got a busted up wall piano from someone in town, and after hauling it to my home I set it by the wall and got to work. I found that having an acoustic piano in the house brings a great creative spirit out of me. I'm not as obsessed with the technical mumbo jumbo as I was with drumset. The fun is the most important part. An acoustic piano fills the space unlike an electric piano. Hearing and feeling the instrument itself is a privelege we don't find too often these days. Although, becuase its acoustic it is quite out of tune... Who knows if it can be re-tuned!</p>

<h2>The Band</h2>
<p>My band, <a href="https://www.retrocowgirlband.com/" class='local'>Retro Cowgirl</a>, was created when two californians moved to Texas in 2020. The three core members of the group decided to move right before the pandemic, which is one of the boldest decisions I'll ever hear of. I joined them shortly after, and played with them for the first time at Vibes Underground in San Antonio, TX. Since then we've been writing and performing together.</p>
