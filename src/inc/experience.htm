<h1>Experience</h1>
<p>I am currently a computer scientist at the <a href='www.swri.org'>Southwest Research Institute</a> in the Itelligent Transportation Systems (Div 10). I started there in June of 2023 after I graduated from Trinity University the month before in May. I was kind of thrown into the fire and the flames, as the project I was working on had the biggest release and a re-bid of the contract at the end of the year. I started off as a support chicken, but then made my way into developing some enhancements and seeing the release all the way through release.</p>

<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>Over the summer of 2022 I was a digital intern at <a href='www.HEB.com'>HEB</a> for 10 weeks. My task was to create an event-sourced database exclusively using actors. Mind you, this is a grocery store, and I did not expect this level of complexity. However, HEB has found its way into literally every Texan it reaches. The phenomenon of the cult of HEB is a thesis for a different kind of degree. I was able to finish my enhancement and it was released to production, so I'm happy its out there somewhere. It was a hybrid position, which didn't really cater to my needs. I'm the guy who asks a ton of questions, especially the dumb ones, and it felt like I wasn't supported in that way by the team. Perhaps they were stressed about a release, or maybe I didn't mesh well with them, but I basically did my whole degree in the language they hired me for so I felt mildly prepared (it was <a href='www.scala-lang.org'>Scala</a>). I ended up not going back because the company culture was kind of confusing. I didn't meet my team during any of the orientation, and all the connections I made on the first week felt a little pointless after they sent me home with a Mac Book and a timesheet. Don't get me wrong, it's a great company to work for. I see a lot of happy people there. But for me, I need something a little more technical.</p>

<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
<p>Personal projects have a weird reputation. Throughout college it was drilled into our heads that personal projects were great for boosting your resume, but whats the point of doing a personal project, on your own time, that isn't involved in any way with what you enjoy outside of school? I'm not going to code a linked-list for fun.</p>

<h3>ORCA</h3>
<p>ORCA is a really cool synthesizer tool that I like to mess with in my free time. It's like making music with MIPS, but fun. I have a couple of demos, but have yet to publish them. Check out the music tab to see anything I've uploaded.</p>

<h3>Chat GPT Help Bot</h3>
<p>An AI-based helper on a website is a great way to expiriment with AI. Although I don't know how good it is, we want it to sell people travel at <a href='www.travelabundance.com'>Travel Abundance</a>. Although I haven't been given the go-ahead on this project, I'll be putting a script on the page that lets visitors prompt the AI for a semi-predefined response. I'm thinking we could have it recognize returning customers by asking them their name, make reccomendations based on age, party compositions (honeymoon, bachelorette party, work trip, etc...), and reasons for travel. I don't like seeing AI making art and especially music, but I think this is a low-tech solution to a simple problem. I also think the tool is hilarious, I've asked it for relationship advice, how to fix a car, and how to stack a nail, 9 eggs, a book, a laptop, and 3 books on top of each other.</p>
