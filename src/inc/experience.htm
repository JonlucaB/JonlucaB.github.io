<h1>Experience</h1>
<div></div>
<h2>Industry</h2>
<p>From June 2023 to June 2024 I was a computer scientist at the <a href='www.swri.org'>Southwest Research Institute</a> in 
    the Itelligent Transportation Systems (Div 10). I worked on a SQL, C#, and Wpf stack, Advanced Traffic Management Software 
    (ATMS) for the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). My secondary teams were under the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation 
    (PennDOT) and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT).
</p>

<p>My work with the FDOT team was on the <a href="sunguidesoftware.com">SunGuide</a> software, a large enterprise software that connected 
operators to respodners, traffic sensors and signals, web services like Center 2 Center, and much more. From my time on the FDOT project I 
adopted deep understanding of: </p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>.NET</li>
    <li>WPF and MvvM</li>
    <li>Test-Driven-Design</li>
    <li>Agile workflow</li>
    <li>White box and Black box unit testing</li>
    <li>Versional control tools such as Git</li>
    <li>Jira and Confluence</li>
    <li>Install shield and InstallScript</li>
    <li>Technical documentation</li>
</ul>

<div></div>
<p>With UDOT and PennDOT I've done a myriad of tasks. Largely, the work was expanding upon the closed-source ActiveITS library used 
    by all of the teams in Division 10. With that library I was able to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Implement the X (formerly known as Twitter) API as a notification method</li>
    <li>Develop a standalone proxy service for encrypted connections to external requests</li>
    <li>Expand Center 2 Center features by impementing new data types into microservice</li>
    <li>Enhance installer with new microservices and dependencies</li>
</ul>

    database exclusively using Scala actors with the Akka library.</p>
    <div></div>
