<h3>Soaring</h3>

<p>Soaring is a fantastic piece of fusion that combines metric modulation, rock, and flashiness all in one (and it comes in a sleek cover too). Written and performed by Don Ellis and a great supporting band, each track brings a new blend to styles thast you may have missed in your music listening. Songs like 'Sladka Pitka, a Turkish inspired piece, and Whiplash (this was not the song played at the end of the movie 'Whiplash,' that was Caravan), an exciting medley of horns, drums, and bass. The vinyl can be found on most online stores, and is a must have for any record collection.</p>
 
<p>I have a small record collection. A record shop in San Antonio, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/crazyrhythmsrecords'>Crazy Rhythm Records</a> has a good selection. I reccomend picking the owner's brains, as they are encyclopedias for music.</p>
